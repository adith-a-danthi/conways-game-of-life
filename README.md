# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton simulation where cells on a grid evolve based on simple rules:

1. Any live cell with 2-3 live neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive.
3. All other cells die or stay dead.

These rules create complex patterns and behaviors from simple initial configurations. It demonstrates how emergent complexity can arise from basic principles.

This is a simple implementation using a 30x30 grid.
